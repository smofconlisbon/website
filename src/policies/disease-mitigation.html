      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4">Our approach</h3>
      <p>
        We will always abide by Portuguese laws at a minimum for the physical
        convention. We have chosen to add some stronger mitigation
        recommendations. We reserve the right to revise our policy to be more
        restrictive if dictated by new circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy does not relate solely to COVID-19. SMOFcon is an
        international event and has attendees from around the world. This policy
        therefore includes the transmission of communicable diseases such as
        influenza and the common cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please be mindful that members of our convention have weak or compromised
        immune systems, and that these may be adversely affected by illnesses such
        as the &lsquo;common cold&rsquo;. What constitutes a mild illness for one
        person may have severe repercussions for others.
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4">Policy</h3>
      <p>
        We strongly recommend that every member is vaccinated and boosted against
        all major communicable diseases for which vaccines are available to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not require proof of any vaccination at the convention, given
        vaccine allergies and the differing availability of vaccines
        internationally to those who have not yet been vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strongly recommend that every member tests daily for COVID-19 and flu
        if they show any relevant symptoms. Additionally, we recommend testing for
        Covid and flu before the convention and being mindful of the infectious
        periods for both illnesses, as these are significant given the higher
        number of immuno-vulnerable or at-risk individuals within the attending
        community.

      </p>
      <p>
        We will not require proof of a negative test at time of badge pickup or
        for spot checking.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strongly recommend that every member regularly and effectively washes
        and dries their hands. When this is not possible, we recommend that hand
        sanitiser is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strongly recommend that online and on-site members get sufficient
        high-quality rest, hydration, and nutrition for their personal needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please do not physically attend the convention if you or any member of
        your household have recently tested positive for COVID-19, influenza or
        any other communicable disease or illness, or if you have any new and
        potentially contagious symptoms which have begun within the previous week.
        Such symptoms include coughing, sneezing, sniffling, running a fever, or
        having digestive issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may ask members who attend the convention when unwell or recovering in
        a way that may adversely affect others &mdash; for example with a
        persistent cough, within the infectious period of an illness, or behaving
        in a way that might put others at risk such as unmasking &mdash; to
        isolate or attend online. We are aware that other medical conditions such
        as asthma or allergies may cause some of these symptoms, and will be
        mindful of this when making a decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will enforce the Code of Conduct in all applicable situations,
        including when another member&lsquo;s choices about disease mitigation do
        not match yours. This includes, but is not limited to, mitigations by
        masking, social distancing, or physical contact. For example, you may not
        encroach on someone&lsquo;s space who has asked you to stay 2 metres away,
        nor may you yell at someone who is not wearing an FFP2 mask. However, we
        do not have exclusive use of the venue and cannot control what happens in
        their public areas, including the bars and restaurants.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will offer what assistance we can to those who are affected by any
        disease or illness at the convention and need to change their travel
        plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        We intend to track reports of COVID-19 from Smofcon 43 for at least two
        weeks after the convention finishes. Please do not report or speculate
        upon anyone else&lsquo;s COVID-19 status in any private or public forum
        without their explicit consent.
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4">Policy context</h3>
      <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that conventions need to be more
        mindful of contagion as a whole. We need to be thoughtful and deliberate
        about our responsibilities regarding contagion by actions such as looking
        at current government policies and discussing situations around
        mutually-exclusive accessibility requirements. This is why we frame this
        in the light of disease mitigation across the board.
      </p>
      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4">Acknowledgements</h3>
      <p>
        We acknowledge the work of previous conventions, particularly all the most
        recent Eastercon events, in creating this policy. This policy takes
        account of local recommendations in place at the time of writing.
