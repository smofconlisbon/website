      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4">Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This Code of Conduct exists to ensure that all participants feel safe,
        respected, and welcome. Our community values diversity, inclusion, and
        mutual respect. Everyone has the right to enjoy the event free from
        harassment, discrimination, or intimidation. The Code of Conduct applies
        to all spaces linked to the convention including virtual spaces. The Code
        of Conduct is a living document and will be updated as needed.
